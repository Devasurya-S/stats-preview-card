## My process

Well I first made my intial commit to git. Then researched on what I am gonna need for this project like the fonts, images and thier links. Once all the preparations were comeplete started coding the mobile layout using css flex propertie and that was day 1. Day 2 I started on the pc layout and well it was easy just had tweak the properties a littile bit. Everytime when i made some considerable changes and if it works then I commited it to git and at the end of the coding session I pushed my code to github. Then Day 3 code review started made some tweaks and corrections to code, it was hard cauz some changes affected the whole layout like crazy and sometimes one layout was affect and fixing it the other one gets afftected. Now the final part fininshing this readme file which seems to be the hardest part.
